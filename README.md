# CR6-Stealthburner-mod

this is an adaptation of the stealthburner for Creality CR6-SE/CR6-Max, I redisigned it to work with the stock strain gauge leveling system.

## Hardware

extruder: LGX lite
hotend: microswiss all metal (should fit most hotends)
Blower fan: GDB5015 50x50x15mm
hotend fan: 40x40x10mm
heat inserts: M3x5x4
screws: M3x6 / M3x10 / M3x14 / M3x18 / M3x30

## Assembly instructions

When everything is printed, proceede with inserting all heat inserts and and mount the hotend to the strain gauge.

### Fan duct 

First slide the mounting bracket in position behind the hotend and fasten it tight to the carriage plate with a M3x10 through the middle whole of the mounting bracket.
Now position the PCB mounting box and the fan duct on top of the bracket (the cables of the strain gauge stay on top of the duct) and use a M3x12 screw to tighten the PCB mounting box, the fan duct and the mounting bracket to the carriage plate from the front. Last step, screw a M3x12 through the bottom hole of the mounting plate from the back, but don't screw it through the fan duct, the fan duct needs to be a little flexible to allow the assembly with the fan cover body later on.

### Extruder

insert the square nuts provided with the extruder in the slots of the bottom of the LGX lite, then fix the extruder to the front body of the case with two M3x18 screws

fasten the cable cover to the rear body using a M3x10 (this is not really necessary, you can skip this step if you like)

and with a M3x18

now join the front body to the rear body and allign everyting. Use a M3x30 screw to fasten everything together.

Remove the standard bowden clip delivered with the LGX Lite is to be removed, and a standard UM2 connector has to be inserted in the top printed part.

Cut a ~37mm long PTFE tube and plug it into the extruder. Now position the whole Part on top of the carriage plate and allign the PTFE tube to the specific whole on top of the hotend, push/slide the part in on top of the carriage plate (the PTFE tube is now in the hotend) and allign the holes of part to those on the carriage plate
Screw a M3x30 from the back of the plate (this can be a little tricky)

and a M3x30 from the front using the specific holes.

### Fan cover

after having put the fans in place (I recommend watching some Stealthburner installing Youtube videos to help you out through this process) position the fan cover in place and use M3x30 screws for the top two holes and the bottom left one, and a M3x18 for the bottom right hole. The fan (and LED) cables should have enough space between the straing gauge and the extruder to reach the PCB freely. You will have to use a bit of force to fit everything in place, now you can fasten the bottom screw of the mounting bracket into the fan duct.
f yeah It's almost complete now!

### PCB Cover

Accomodate the PCB on the PCB mounting plate and use two M3x6 screws to tighten up. Now connect all the JST connectors and make sure that everything is in the right slot. Screw a M3x10 through the heat insert on the PCB mounting plate, but don't screw it completly through yet.
Position the PCB mounting plate in place on the side of the build and allign the the M3x10 you just inserted  to the heat insert in the PCB mountin box, then tighten up using the screw.

last but not least, slide the PCB cover in place

Remember to adjust the Vref of the extruder stepper to 0.8 for the LGX lite and to set e-steps to 562 as described in the LGX lite installation guide.
Print and install the LGX filament sensor mount. Connect the filament sensor to the extruder with a PTFE tube, turn your machine on and voil√† it's ready!
